    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

    <p>
Effective Date: 08-06-2025

At Yes Guru Library, we strive to provide the best subscription services to our customers. Please read our refund policy carefully before making a purchase.

1. Subscription Payments
Our subscriptions are billed monthly as per the selected plan (3 months or 6 months), with automatic recurring payments of â‚¹700 per month.

Payments are processed securely through Razorpay.

2. Refund Eligibility
All subscription fees are non-refundable once the subscription payment is successfully processed.

We do not provide refunds or credits for partial months, unused services, or cancellations made during the subscription period.

If you believe there has been an error in billing or payment, please contact our support team immediately at yesguru2030@gmail.com.

3. Cancellation Policy
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account or by contacting our support.

Cancellation will stop the future billing but will not refund any payments already processed.

Your subscription benefits will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.

4. Refund Requests
Refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

To request a refund or report an issue, contact us at yesguru2030@gmail.com with your subscription details and payment receipt.

We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests depending on the situation.

5. Chargebacks
Initiating chargebacks with your bank or payment provider without contacting us first may result in suspension or termination of your subscription.

6. Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time.

Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.

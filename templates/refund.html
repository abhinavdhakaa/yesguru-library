    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 8, 2025</p>

    <p>
        At <strong>Yes Guru Library</strong>, we strive to provide the best subscription services to our customers. Please read our refund policy carefully before making a purchase.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Subscription Payments</h3>
    <p>
        Our subscriptions are billed monthly as per the selected plan (3 months or 6 months), with automatic recurring payments of ₹700 per month.
        All payments are processed securely through Razorpay.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Refund Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
        All subscription fees are non-refundable once the subscription payment is successfully processed.
        We do not provide refunds or credits for partial months, unused services, or cancellations made during the subscription period.
        If you believe there has been an error in billing or payment, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:yesguru2030@gmail.com">yesguru2030@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>
        You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account or by contacting our support.
        Cancellation will stop future billing but will not refund any payments already processed.
        Your subscription benefits will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Refund Requests</h3>
    <p>
        Refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

        We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests depending on the situation.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>
        Initiating chargebacks with your bank or payment provider without contacting us first may result in the suspension or termination of your subscription.
